                <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Betting</h2>
                <p>Before beginning to bet, you should read through our General Conditions for Betting which apply to you and to each of your betting transactions.
                    <br />By entering into any betting transactions on our site, you agree to be bound by both the General Conditions.<br />

                    All bets placed in the system are the clients responsibility.<br /> Any miss bets due to software glitch or website maintenance will not be Betzhub's responsibility and clients have to bear any or such losses incurred during this downtime.<br />

                    One side bets for multiple markets won't be entertained, if done so bonus amount will be deducted and 5% tax will be charged on the winning.<br />

                    Trying to claim a bonus by making Lay & Back in a short interval will be deemed as offensive and the bonus amount will be deducted.

All of these documents are incorporated by reference and form part of these General Conditions.<br />

                    Please note that there are separate Rules and Regulations for each of our Exchange and other products. <br />The rules governing how markets are offered, managed and/or settled are not the same for every market on each product.<br /> In certain circumstances, a bet that is settled as a winner on one product may be settled as a loser on the other product (and vice versa).<br /> Additionally, different settlement rules may apply so that, for example, bets that are a winner on one product may be settled as a dead heat or be voided on the other product.<br /> Customers must ensure that they familiarise themselves with the relevant rules that apply to the bets that they place on Betzhub 's products.<br />

                    By entering into any betting transactions, you agree to be bound by these General Conditions and the Specific Conditions relevant to your betting transaction (together "the Agreement").<br />

                <p>General <br />For everything other than horse racing and greyhound racing, if a market is not scheduled to be turned in-play but Betzhub fails to suspend the market at the relevant time, then:<br />If the event has a scheduled 'off' time, all bets matched after that scheduled off time will be void
                    <br />If the event does not have a scheduled 'off' time, Betzhub will use its reasonable endeavours to ascertain the time of the actual 'off' and all bets after the time of the 'off' determined by Run567 will be void.<br />For horse racing and greyhound racing, if a market is not scheduled to be turned in-play but Betzhub fails to suspend the market at the relevant time, then all bets matched after the official 'off' time will be void.<br />Betzhub aims to use its reasonable endeavours to suspend in-play markets at the start of and at the end of the event. However, regardless of what it says in the Market Information, Betzhub does not guarantee that such markets will be suspended at the relevant time.
                    <br />Betzhub will not part-suspend outcomes/selections in an Exchange market that has been turned in-play (although it may do so in Fixed Odds market).
                    <br />Betzhub customers are responsible for managing their in-play bets at all times.
                    <br />For the purposes of in-play betting, customers should be aware that transmissions described as "live" by some broadcasters may actually be delayed or pre-recorded. The extent of any delay may vary depending on the set-up through which they are receiving pictures or data.
                    <br />The availability of an in-play market on our Exchange product for a particular event does not necessarily mean that there will be an equivalent in-play market for the same event on our Fixed Odds product.<br />All markets other than soccer markets - not suspending at the time of the 'off'
                    <br />In relation to markets which are scheduled to be turned in-play, Betzhub aims to use its reasonable endeavours to turn such markets in-play at the time of the 'off'. However, Betzhub does not guarantee that such markets will be suspended and turned in-play at the time of the 'off'.
                    <br />If a market is scheduled to be turned in-play but Betzhub fails to suspend the market at the time of the 'off' and the market is not turned in-play at any time during the event, all bets matched after the scheduled time of the 'off' will be void (in the case of horse racing and greyhound racing, bets will be void from the official rather than the scheduled 'off' time) UNLESS it can be established that the bet was placed before the official off time or the actual time of the off. If the event does not have a scheduled 'off' time, Betzhub will use its reasonable endeavours to ascertain the time of the actual 'off' and all bets after the time of the 'off' determined by Betzhub will be void.
                    <br />If a market is scheduled to be turned in-play but Betzhub fails to suspend the market at the time of the 'off', but the market is turned in-play at a later time during the event, all bets matched after the time of the 'off' will stand HOWEVER the price may be adjusted by Betzhub and the bets may be settled accordingly to Betzhub prices.
                    <br />Soccer markets - not suspending at kick-off
                    <br />In relation to soccer markets that are scheduled to be turned in-play, Betzhub aims to use its reasonable endeavours to turn such markets in-play at kick-off and to suspend such markets on the occurrence of a Material Event (see definition of "Material Event" below). However, Betzhub does not guarantee that markets will be suspended and turned in-play at kick-off.<br />
                    If a market is scheduled to be turned in-play but Betzhub fails to suspend the market at kick-off and the market is not turned in-play at any time during the match, all bets matched after the scheduled time of the kick-off will be void UNLESS it can be established that the bet was actually placed before the actual time of kick-off.
                    <br />If a market is scheduled to be turned in-play but Betzhub fails to suspend the market at kick-off, but the market is turned in-play at a later time during the match, all bets matched after the scheduled time of the kick-off will stand HOWEVER the price may be adjusted by Betzhub and the bets may be settled accordingly to Betzhub prices.
                    <br />For the purpose of this rule, a "Material Event" shall mean a goal being scored, a penalty being awarded or a player being sent off.
